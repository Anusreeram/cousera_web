          <section id="chicken">Chickens are domestic (farm) birds that cannot fly. The adult female chicken is called a hen, the adult male is called a rooster, and the young are called chicks. There are many different breeds of chicken that are different sizes and colors. Bantams are miniature chicken breeds. A group of chickens is called a flock. The scientific name of the chicken is Gallus domesticus (genus and species)<br>There are more than 25 billion chickens in the world, and dozens of breeds. With so many of them, it seems only natural to want to know more about this peculiar bird. Here are some scientific facts mixed in with some purely fun facts, so enjoy the read! The chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus, is a domestic subspecies of the red junglefowl, a member of the pheasant family that is native to Asia. Genetic studies have found that the grey junglefowl also contributed to the chicken's evolution.
         According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, "Humans first domesticated chickens of Indian origin for the purpose of cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Very little formal attention was given to egg or meat production..."
         We've already said there are more than 25 billion chickens in the world. This makes the chicken more numerous than any other bird on the planet.
         The United States alone consumes 8 billion chickens a year, and around 250 eggs per capita.
         There are approximately 280 million laying hens producing 50 billion eggs in the U.S. each year.
         Adult male chickens over a year old are called roosters in Australia, Canada, and the U.S., but are called cocks in the U.K. Males less than a year old are called cockerels, and castrated males are called capons. Adult females are hens, and young females less than a year old are called pullets, although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs. Young chickens are called chicks.
         Chickens begin communicating before they are hatched, when the mother hen makes a purring noise towards her eggs and the chicks peep back at her from inside the unhatched eggs.
         There are approximately 30 distinct vocalizations that chickens use to communicate with each other.
         Chickens are omnivores, meaning they eat seeds and insects, but also have been known to eat mice and lizards.
         Chickens can recognize around 100 different faces.
         Chickens can't fly very far, but they can get airborne enough to make it over a fence.
         Roosters perform a little dance called 'tidbitting' in which they make sounds (food calls) and move their head up and down, picking up and dropping a bit of food. Researchers have found that females prefer males that often perform tidbitting and have larger, brighter combs on top of their heads.</section>
